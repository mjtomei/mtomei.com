    <h2>Turtles</h2>

“It’s turtles all the way down.” This is the answer to living with hope for the future. We seem to have made up gods that we pretend are loving to give us hope. Anyone who sees through the veil sees that those stories probably contain a lot of truth (especially if they are very old) but still are not literally true. This can easily cause believers who grow up and start seeing the truth to lose hope. The bigger truth is, if the god in control of us is evil, there is nothing we can do anyways. We are going to die or suffer whatever he wants.

</p><p>

One of the most fundamental physical laws is that entropy always decreases in a closed system. That seems to imply that we will all be gone at some point, although there could be some law above that that we don’t understand yet. In any case, local to this planet, entropy is somehow increasing. We seem to somehow have a protective shell from things like nuclear holocaust and other disasters. Maybe that is only from the power of the sun or maybe it is some higher power. We have a responsibility to take advantage of that gift we have been given while it is still here. There is always something we can do to help each other.

</p><p>

And this applies even to that god above whatever the highest god we have contact with now is and to the natural law we know of. We don’t know what is all the way at the top yet and may never know. We can love god for the good he has done for us and help each other like Jesus and many others taught the masses. We can hope that any bad was done for a higher purpose. So even though we don’t know, it only makes sense to act as if whatever unassailable god in control is good. Anyways, from my perspective, he does seem pretty good. It seems like we have a path towards global well being and prosperity.

Theorizing on what the mechanism for a good god is, maybe there is another law of entropy that destructive high entropy systems are more likely to be targeted by others. So a purely destructive entity is the most likely target for destruction themselves.

</p><p>

There are many examples of this. One is at the level of societies. Serial killers or serial rapists are targeted most aggressively. That also acts as an evolutionary pressure which creates supremely effective and intelligent destructive forces. But in the end both the higher and lower power constructive entities would team up against the most destructive for their own preservation once they achieved enough intelligence, trust, and technology. The destructive forces work against other destructive and constructive forces both which makes them weaker. 

</p><p>

Another related phenomenon seems to be varying ability to resist becoming destructive with power given by others. This ability is the seed for successful coalitions of and creation of more powerful constructive forces. The only guaranteed way to check if someone can handle power is to give it to them, so this also points to the mechanism for failure of organizations. Once the great man or idea that seeded it is gone or decayed, the organization slowly decays. This is sometimes delayed by things intelligent enough to create a stand in for that seed which is a replica or more lasting version of itself. Although on the far end of the spectrum where a perfect copy is made, that is taking away any independece from the material the copy was made of which reduces the ability for anything new to come about.

</p><p>

This could be a restating of the ideas of karma (more destructive entities are targeted) and dharma (be constructive and team up, gather power according to your ability to handle it well) that fits in better with the western scientific method.

</p><p>

If this is a natural law, what other evidence is there of it, and what experiments can we come up with to gain more confidence? One class of experiments would be social ones. How resilient are mock societies to introduction of bad actors, and what are the mechanisms? Are there certain people who are a better seed for social cohesion and how can this be measured? Physical experiments exist as well. Crystals seem like another example we could use to study the effects. They create perfect copies of themselves. Is there anything in quantum physics? Maybe the missing piece from a quantum computer which will solve the decoherence problem is some “seed” we haven’t found yet. Some people have theorized that the human brain is a quantum computer, so maybe it is there in the pineal gland. We can't forget about the conflicting need for something like genetic diversity either. Hopefully there is more than one seed so that things can stay resilient to targeted disease.

</p><p>

What evidence do we have from the past that explains why we never discovered this in the west and added it to the physics curriculum if it is true? For example, maybe the Stanford prison experiment which has since been debunked was meant to hide this law from us for some reason. Are there bad actors, and how do we uncover them? Hopefully they were only applying negative pressure until we were ready, and now is the time for that pressure to stop.
