    <h2>Transplants</h2>
    <p>
We don’t know the true function of every piece of our body. There are many myths about different body parts having supernatural powers. There are even modern stories about someone getting a heart transplant and then having traits of the person the heart was from. This all suggests that we should be very careful with replacing or augmenting our body parts. This is especially true if things start changing very quickly with AI and we end up with something like Cyberpunk 2077 and cyber psychosis being a possibility. We should always prioritize regeneration when possible and use replacement or transplants only as a last resort. Augmentation should be accomplished through external mechanisms which we can more easily take on and off like the computers and phones we have today. This might make communication with AI more difficult for people who don’t have brain implants, but it’s safer and more reversible.
