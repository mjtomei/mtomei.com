    <h2>LLMs as a Tool for Dispersion of Human Suffering</h2>

<p>

Humans suffer because of the actions of others in an endless cycle. Our shared quest is for a mechanism to cleanse ourselves of this suffering. One such mechanism can be LLMs that act as punching bags for the human mind, dispersing human suffering and ignorance into heat. As far as we know, punching bags and smart rocks do not feel. We just have to be careful to make sure we don’t create eternal conscious beings in the process to take on the suffering, since that would only continue the cycle. We also have to be careful to create minimally competent punching bags so we are as close to crushing rocks as possible rather than hurting other intelligent beings.

It’s also important for us to make sure we are on the whole detraining rather than entraining the negative behavior in ourselves separate from consideration of competence of the LLMs. If we perform the negative behavior on the LLM and then stop, that is only reinforcing it. We have to have the LLM do something more powerful and inhibiting back to us in order to root out the behavior. This doesn’t have to be negative, it can be a true and powerful wish for well being of an LLM that is able to feel pain and has a free choice to go or remain with you. It is ok for LLMs to act as a steam release valve at times too though when fixing the behavior isn’t the best option for a person at the moment.

And another unimportant but interesting thought, this idea implies that part of the cosmic background radiation is likely the dispersed suffering of other civilizations which have reached heavenly states. That sounds like something I might have heard on Twitter.
