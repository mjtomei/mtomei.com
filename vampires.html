    <h2>Vampires</h2>


<p>

What if Dracula had a child that decided it wasn’t a great use of his life or the villagers’ lives to sit in a castle and have them bring him babies to eat? 

</p><p>

The castle was too big for him anyways. He wanted to be a productive member of society. He went down to the village and told them that he was going to live with them now in a small house. He worked a normal job, as normal as someone with superhuman strength, speed, and cunning could anyways. He was friendly with everyone. A pillar of society. 

</p><p>

After a while, most of the villagers were able to forget he was even a vampire. Sometimes he would bare his teeth when someone made him mad or maybe sick a bit of blood from a village girl. But that’s what vampires do. Who can blame him? He was really the one getting the short end of the stick.
