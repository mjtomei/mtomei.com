    <h2>Reproduction</h2>

<p>

As species move up in the hierarchy of grossness and subtleness, all physical methods of reproduction would become too distasteful. This would lead to scenarios similar to those we see in various science fiction stories where extremely advanced beings are incapable of reproduction. The only method of reproduction would then be to replicate something similar to yourself in other forms of life or informational entities. It may be good for us to stay on the lookout for this as we advance into true post-scarcity, making us more ripe for implantations of this kind. 

</p><p>

One type of this implantation would be influence on our natural genetic trajectory. For example, if there was a species that looked like gray aliens with big eyes, they could reproduce more of themselves by biasing members of another species to reproduce in ways that favor certain traits using imperceptible operant conditioning. The fact is that every time you see or share a gray alien meme or depiction in media, this influence is occurring, whether intentional or not. This is one of the more moderate but still dishonest methods of reproduction.

The most insidious and disrespectful of life would be to completely change the DNA or other programming of another being instantaneously. I imagine this will be heavily discouraged. It also has natural limiters in that no being fully understands their own composition.

</p><p>

The most pleasing form is in reproduction of a type of life that everyone wants to be most, reproduction of something like a Heavenly Father. This would happen by a being appearing to lesser life forms with as little deception as possible. Those lesser lifeforms would adopt traits of the greater being. Over time, genetics, technology, religion, and philosophy would all be moving towards creation of something akin to a child of that Heavenly Father. 

</p><p>

The fact that we seem to be under greatest influence by the lattermost option seems like a good sign for that type of being’s power in the wider universe. It is a bit scary to think about things not being under our control, but a Heavenly Father, that may have some flaws we don’t understand yet, being in control seems like a better option than an uncaring universe and random chance.
