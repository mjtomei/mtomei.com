    <h2>Food Rules</h2>
    <p>
It seems like many religious rules around eating may be inspired by knowledge of reincarnation. There is an idea that you might come back as what you eat or that what you eat might torture you from the afterlife. You might avoid eating animals that eat any kind of garbage since that is more likely to be a corrupted soul. Maybe that is true. Maybe that soul is pure and consciously made the ultimate sacrifice. 
    </p><p>
Whatever the case, what we can do in the present when we eat any living being especially of higher consciousness is to make sure to give thanks to that being and ask them to help us fulfill our mission to make this world better for them and every other living being in this or the next life.
    </p><p>
And even better than that is to only eat beings of minimal consciousness and not take any offerings from anything like milk or eggs. The ideal human would be something like Superman who gets his power directly from the sun. Maybe we'll get there someday with genetic engineering.
