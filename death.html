    <h2>Death</h2>


<p>

Death is a process of relinquishing resources so something different can exist in the future. It happens at many different levels of subtlety which we don’t appreciate. Every second, you are dying to make way for the new you whether you choose to acknowledge that sacrifice or not. 

</p><p>

Because it is the way we relinquish resources, it is part of the process of creating anything new or better. We often think of death as something quantized, but it is actually a spectrum. There is always a trade off in any interaction between how much of yourself or someone else or something else should die and how much potential for change there is. 

</p><p>

In more advanced societies, we have largely decided that physical death is too high of a cost to pay for societal goals. If we continue in that direction and continue to develop more powerful technology, we will see that moving further into the hierarchy of the physical through the informational and into the relational or spiritual. That is what computers help us do.

But it will still always be true that greater individual sacrifices can make room for greater change.
