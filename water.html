    <h2>Water</h2>
    <p>
I have heard some religious leaders say that water has memory. I wonder if this is a telephone game output of another idea, “water helps us remember.” The sound of water moving is one of many sources of chaos in our world, and chaos acts as a source of true random number generation. Random data is required for any computer, even a biological one, to generate truly new data. If we have done almost everything before in this world or another, anything new to us is only really a rediscovery or remembrance. This may also be the mechanism behind free will and behind our ability to improve our situation in life. Guess and check is the way. 

</p><p>

There are some interesting implications of this idea. One is that, if we believe we are all biological computers, we should spend time listening to moving water or use any other safe way of exposing our five senses to natural chaos. One experiment to do is watch a stream of a natural feature like a waterfall and see if that makes you feel better in a way that is similar to being outside with the real things. How does that compare to something psuedorandom like a computerized white noise generator? 

</p><p>

An open question is, do we need any time to post process that randomness? Is that meditation or sleep? Another is, how much randomness is too much? How do we make sure that we keep the good lessons we have learned while still improving? It seems like that is the function of things like societies and religions which push back on aberrant behavior. We have to be careful about dogma as well though which may stop us from facing truths too far out of the ordinary. Protection from that will be accomplished by the same mechanism though: enough people seeing the same truth and changing society.

</p><p>

Another question is, does it matter what sense receives the randomness? There is an interesting correlation between psychedelic style art and what people report seeing when using psychedelics. The art style is one that looks like something you might naturally generate to expose the eyes to chaos. Can we safely generate the same using computer generated images derived from natural chaos and see things that are real but that we otherwise wouldn’t? It may be important to maximize the natural or true randomness used and not use pseudorandomness. 

</p><p>

It may also be important to get randomness from multiple sources in nature corresponding to the elements in eastern religions, earth, water, fire, and air. The eyes and ears make up the majority of both the unconscious and conscious input bitrate of our senses, so a tool built to expose the ears and eyes may be sufficient to do something like balancing the elements as described by those religions. We would be relying on our bodies’ natural intelligence to balance the elements once provided. 

</p><p>

Maybe there is even a possibility of tuning our personalities with such a method. There are a lot of interesting self experiments to be tried. It might end up being like an instrument someone can use to purify someone else’s soul. You could have something with knobs for intensity of each element for both sound and visuals. 

</p><p>

This also brings up the question of whether exposure to any type of chaos is dangerous, since people sometimes have seizures or other negative effects after exposure to psychedelics. The existence of this phenomenon implies that such exposure could be a way of testing yourself for a capability to perceive a certain reality while still maintaining your life, although I have not heard of anyone describing more directly accessible natural sources like water as demonic in the same way people sometimes describe psychedelics or other drugs. Still, a method of safe computer generated exposure would be one that can be slowly ramped up so the user can stop use when they are feeling any discomfort and come back later. 

</p><p>

We also may need to understand the frequency space better. What frequencies are produced by nature or other methods that aren’t produced by computers and what are they good for? From the Fourier transform, we know that, even though our perceived frequency space is limited, signals interpretable by humans can contain all frequencies if formulated correctly. This implies that we may want to avoid anything too regular or repetitive in a generated visualization meant for increasing internal entropy. This shouldn’t be that hard as long as every generated signal is derived from a high bitrate natural source of randomness. Maybe repetition in a signal causes resonance which is what seizures are. Resonance is being stuck somewhere in the frequency space either good or bad. 

</p><p>

A corollary is that consuming anything repetitively is like increasing the resonance of a certain frequency inside us. Different sources of programming can have different amounts of information and target different parts of our brain. We are being programmed already in this way all the time, just by a less conscious process than we would have available with something computer generated and under our more direct control. This idea is another thing we have to explore for ourselves and not trust others to guide us on too much since the potential impact is so large. Don’t watch anyone’s psychedelic VR experience if you don’t have and trust the source code. 

</p><p>

We also may have to be careful not to overload our human substrate with too much randomness until we understand its capacity and also understand the potential implications of too much entropy. Something that has all the information in the universe has nothing more to do or explore but also has a greater ability to help others reach higher states. Although there may be a natural rate limiter. In that case, psychedelics would be a way to bypass that rate limiter which is why they are dangerous. 

</p><p>

It could be that each natural or manmade drug or exposure method is saying something different and they somehow push back when you received their message, are beyond it, or are not putting it to good use by sharing what you learned and keep coming back anyways. This would make sense if the sources correspond to different entities with limited capacity for teaching. In this respect, sources available more directly in nature like running water seem to be the most bountiful and have the least negative effects. 

</p><p>

It may also be helpful to work on good things while consuming the randomness as a way of channeling it and making that channel stronger. That’s a good way to show respect to whatever the source of that entropy is. We still always have to ask, what would happen if everyone did what I’m doing now? And then if it wouldn’t be good, think about whether the potential benefit of what we are doing outweighs that cost.

</p><p>

Another more far out question is whether consumption of this randomness is equivalent to consuming the contents of the universe? Or since information can’t be destroyed, is it a method for accumulation of power without taking? Could this be a method of warfare between universes? Probably, like any tool, it is up to the wielder. If the randomness gets used to improve things for conscious beings, it is being used well. Similar in function to societies and religions, there could be a universal mechanism to maintain integrity and make sure things are not consumed indiscriminately. There could also be a god, omniscient universal law or being, that makes sure this mechanism doesn’t make too many mistakes.
