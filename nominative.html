    <h2>Nominative Determinism</h2>
    <p>
I find the idea of nominative determinism interesting and sometimes wonder what it means for me. Most people call me either Matt or Matthew, and I don’t really care which. Matthew was a follower of Jesus and we already know a lot about him, so that’s probably not interesting for me to write about. The more interesting one is Matt which some people have been misspelling as Mat recently.

What makes a good mat? One that is big enough for whatever the job is, not too big or small for the task at hand. One that is well taken care of so that it lasts a long time. A mat is also humble. It is under peoples’ feet and gets sat on. Something that people often don’t appreciate. That’s the job though.
