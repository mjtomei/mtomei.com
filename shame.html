    <h2>Shame</h2>

<p>

Shame is a request that you take an action to fix something wrong. There can be external or internal sources both for the request and the thing that is wrong. The thing that is wrong is not always the thing that people ask you to fix, although there is always something wrong when you feel shame. This conception is a way to reframe guilt given the fact that sin is a burden shared by everyone, even though we try to parcel it out and eject those with the biggest parcels. Paradoxically, everything you and others do was a result of past causes out of anyone’s control, but you still should take actions now to ameliorate as much as possible of all the things you can identify as bad. The productive thing to do is redirect it as another source of energy for improving our shared situation rather than to try and pass it off or shut it out.
