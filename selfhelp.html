    <h2>Self Help</h2>

<p>

There are a lot of methods people sell for increasing productivity or losing weight or other things we want for ourselves. They almost never work, and I think it’s because we all know that we don’t matter as individuals. The only real reason we have to improve ourselves is to improve things for the people around us. The implication is that if you think something would be good or bad for you to do and want to change, you should think through the impact it will have on the people around you. Write it out or even talk about it with another person. Then you’ll have a cleaner energy relative to self help style methods.

This is also the reason why things that people have described as sinful are sinful. A sin is something you do that has a short term positive impact for yourself or for a small circle of people around you but has a greater negative impact on the whole. Since you are also a part of that greater whole, the truth is that you made things worse for yourself too. So avoiding sin isn’t just about being altruistic, it’s about being selfish in the most intelligent way possible, which is to acknowledge that you aren’t actually a separate self or separate group of selves from everybody else.
