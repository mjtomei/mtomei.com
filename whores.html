    <h2>Whores</h2>

<p>

The reason many people don’t like whores isn’t because they feel a need to disincentivize selling ourselves but because they aren’t subtle enough. They are selling themselves in the physical realm which many of us feel like we should be done with. But everyone is a whore to something.

What is a young woman who dresses modestly at church and makes all the men want to marry her and start a stable family? God’s whore. What is a church going man who starts a business, get’s in shape, and makes all the women want to marry him and start a stable family? Also God’s whore. Why is it better to be God’s whore than man’s? At least a man will sometimes talk to you after.

The truth is that we don’t have an option whether to be whores but only to maximize our payout. We also don’t have a choice in what gets us off or who we are skilled at servicing. It’s a function of genetics and societal conditioning. So our task, if we do believe in some hierarchy of pimps, is to figure out how to simultaneously whore ourselves out for the current master as well as the higher ones.

For example, in this piece, I am a whore for discord and attention and a whore for reason and truth. I am a whore for Satan the deceiver and also for our Heavenly Father. Maybe that is a way to push off responsibility, but that seems proper for my station anyways. And it’s more fun.

This line of reasoning carries an explanation for why Jesus spent so much time with actual whores. He was able to demonstrate this concept in practice. Prostitutes can simultaneously be involved in the profession of selling their body and having an indispensable impact in God’s grand plan.
