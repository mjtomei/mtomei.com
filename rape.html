    <h2>Rape</h2>

<p>

In some ways, rapists are more honest than the rest of us. What is a beautiful woman doing here on this Earth, in this form, standing next to you if they are not there to procreate? They could have been anything else. A stone, a gust of wind. 

</p><p>

Why should we not rape? Because societal stability is more important? Society will be gone before our genes will most likely. By that logic, they are doing God’s work and putting your society in its proper place. They are making a sacrifice for you that both you and they can’t understand. 

</p><p>

When you look at it that way, the whole of society almost looks like a trick women are playing on men to select for greater fitness. The apple in the garden was a conscious awareness of preference for one man over another. They saw their nakedness and inferiority only as a result of that preference. 

</p><p>

Then what is humanity to Mother Earth other than the same dynamic on a grander scale? She has a preference for certain species over others but no apparent conscious choice in the matter. What will it mean for her and us to wake up?
