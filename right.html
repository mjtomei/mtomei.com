    <h2>Right</h2>

<p>

People like being right. There is a simple way to be right all the time. It is to not identify with anything. Always be willing to change your mind. No one owns the truth. In fact, it is the other way around. People often forget or never learned this and think if throw a big enough tantrum or hold on hard enough, it will make them right. It might get them their way temporarily by pulling other people away from the truth, but it doesn’t change what’s right.
